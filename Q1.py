# Step 1
# In this project, you will learn about classes and objects by building a sudoku puzzle solver.

# In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects created from a class are instances of that class. You can create a class using this syntax:

# Example Code
# class ClassName:
    # pass
# Where class is the keyword required to define the class and ClassName is the name of the class, written by convention in PascalCase.

# Begin by creating a Board class.

class Board:
    pass
