# Step 3
# The instantiation creates an empty object. But classes can have methods, which are like local functions for each instance. Within a class, methods are declared as follows:

# Example Code
# class ClassName:
    # def method_name():
        # pass
# Inside the Board class, replace pass with an empty method spam.

class Board:
    def spam():
        pass
    
gameboard = Board()
